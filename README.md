In this project, I used CSS, HTML, and JS to create a website, where your mouse acts like a pen on a whiteboard. 

Where it hovers across the grid, the block gets colored in. 

Right now it uses random colors, but it can be changed to the default purple or any other color.

What I learned:

1. how to create a grid
2. reloading a page and updating it with new parameters
3. re-inforced other DOM manipulation tools
